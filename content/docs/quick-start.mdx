## Setup your cluster

You need a Kubernetes cluster to run SREGym. For detailed setup instructions, see the [Cluster Setup](/docs/cluster-setup) guide.

## Running an Agent

### Quick Start

To get started with the included Stratus agent:

1. Create your `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file and configure your model and API key.

3. Run the benchmark:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Monitoring with Dashboard

SREGym provides a dashboard to monitor the status of your evaluation. The dashboard runs automatically when you start the benchmark with `python main.py` and can be accessed at `http://localhost:11451` in your web browser.

## Next Steps

Now that you've run your first agent, you can:

- Learn about [MCP Tools](/docs/mcp-tools) available for your agent
- Read the guide on [Running Your Own Agent](/docs/running-your-own-agent) to create custom agents
- Check out [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) if you run into problems
