title: MCP Tools
description: Complete reference for MCP tools available in SREGym for agent interaction with the cluster and benchmark
---

The benchmark is driven by agent submissions via the `submit` MCP tool. Each submission advances the benchmark to the next phase. To test your agent, run [`main.py`](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/blob/main/main.py) to start the benchmark, then have your agent submit answers at each phase.

SREGym provides a suite of MCP tools that enable agents to interact with the cluster and benchmark:

## Observability Tools

- **`get_services`**: Retrieve the list of service names from Jaeger
- **`get_operations`**: Query available operations for a specific service from Jaeger
- **`get_traces`**: Get Jaeger traces for a given service in the last n minutes
- **`get_metrics`**: Query real-time metrics data from Prometheus using PromQL expressions

## Cluster Management Tools

- **`exec_kubectl_cmd_safely`**: Execute kubectl commands against the Kubernetes cluster. Converts natural language to kubectl commands and executes them. Can get/describe/edit Kubernetes deployments, services, and other components. Takes one query at a time and requires namespace names for most queries
- **`exec_read_only_kubectl_cmd`**: Execute read-only kubectl commands (e.g., get, describe, logs, top, events). A restricted version of `exec_kubectl_cmd_safely` that only allows non-destructive operations
- **`rollback_command`**: Roll back the last kubectl command executed with `exec_kubectl_cmd_safely`
- **`get_previous_rollbackable_cmd`**: Get a list of previously executed commands that can be rolled back. When calling `rollback_command` multiple times, commands are rolled back in the order of this list

## Benchmark Interaction

- **`submit`**: Submit task results to the benchmark to progress to the next phase

## Example Usage

The Stratus agent in [`clients/stratus`](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/tree/main/clients/stratus) demonstrates usages of these MCP tools in an agent.

## Testing Your Tools

We recommend using [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to test MCP tools before integrating them into your agent.
