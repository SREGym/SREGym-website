## Docker and Kind Issues

### Docker Issues

Ensure Docker is running within your WSL2 environment. Verify with `docker ps` to list running containers.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check Docker Desktop is running (if using WSL2)
- Verify Docker daemon is accessible: `docker info`
- Restart Docker if needed

### Cluster Creation Failures

Check that Docker is correctly installed and that your system has enough resources (CPU, memory). Examine the output of `kind export logs <cluster-name>` for details.

**Common causes:**
- Insufficient system resources (CPU/memory)
- Docker not running or misconfigured
- Port conflicts
- Incorrect kind configuration file

**Solutions:**
- Check system resources: `docker stats`
- Review kind logs: `kind export logs <cluster-name>`
- Verify kind configuration file references correct image
- Ensure no port conflicts on required ports

### Deployment Problems

Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view pod logs and diagnose application issues. Make sure that your `kind-config.yaml` file references the correct image.

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
2. View pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
3. Describe pod for events: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
4. Verify image exists and is accessible
5. Check `kind-config.yaml` references correct image name

### Resource Allocation

WSL2 may require additional resources. Adjust the WSL2 settings in your `.wslconfig` file on Windows if you encounter performance issues.

**WSL2 Configuration:**

Create or edit `.wslconfig` in your Windows user directory:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=8GB
processors=4
swap=2GB
```

After modifying `.wslconfig`, restart WSL2:
```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

Then restart your WSL2 distribution.

## Ansible Issues

### Host Key Authentication Errors

If you're running into issues from Ansible related to host key authentication, try typing `yes` in your terminal for each node, or proceed with the following steps:

You can create a file in the same directory as the Ansible README called `ansible.cfg` to turn off that warning:

```yaml
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```

<Callout type="warning">
Be mindful about the security implications of disabling host key checking. Only use this in trusted environments.
</Callout>

## General Troubleshooting

### Checking Cluster Status

Verify your cluster is running correctly:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

All nodes should show `Ready` status.

### Viewing Logs

To diagnose issues with specific components:

```bash
# View pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# View logs for all pods in a namespace
kubectl logs -n <namespace> --all-containers=true
```

### Dashboard Access

If the dashboard at `http://localhost:11451` is not accessible, common issues:

1. Verify the benchmark is running with `python main.py`
2. Check if the port is already in use
3. Review the console output for any error messages
