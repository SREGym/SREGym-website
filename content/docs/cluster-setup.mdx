description: Setting up your Kubernetes cluster for SREGym using an emulated cluster (Kind) or a full Kubernetes cluster (Ansible)
---

## Setup your cluster

We currenlty support both local and remote setup. The options are:

- **Emulated cluster (Kind)**: Quick setup for local development - see [Cluster Setup](/docs/cluster-setup)
- **Kubernetes Cluster (Ansible)**: Production setup for CloudLab or remote servers - see [Cluster Setup](/docs/cluster-setup)

## Kubernetes Cluster

SREGym supports any kubernetes cluster that your `kubectl` context is set to, whether it's a cluster from a cloud provider or one you build yourself.

We have an Ansible playbook to setup clusters on providers like [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/) and our own machines. This instruction covers using Ansible to build a remote cluster for SREGym. This will work on any servers you have access to.

### 1) Modify the inventory file

```bash
cp inventory.yml.example inventory.yml
```

Modify the IPs and user names in the inventory file accordingly, `inventory.yml`.

### 2) Run the Ansible playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml setup_cluster.yml
```

After these, you should see every node running inside the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Common Errors

For troubleshooting Ansible-related issues, including host key authentication errors, see the [Host Key Authentication Errors](/docs/troubleshooting#host-key-authentication-errors) section in the Troubleshooting guide.

## Emulated cluster

SREGym can be run on an emulated cluster using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on your local machine. However, not all problems are supported.

```bash
# For x86 machines
kind create cluster --config kind/kind-config-x86.yaml

# For ARM machines
kind create cluster --config kind/kind-config-arm.yaml
```
