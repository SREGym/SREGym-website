description: Guide for developers working on SREGym - testing tools and debugging
---

## Overview

This guide covers testing tools for developers working on SREGym. For development setup, code style, and contribution process, see the [Contributing](/docs/contributing) guide.

## Testing Tools

### cli.py

SREGym CLI client (`cli.py`). Use this for debugging and platform development work. Otherwise use `main.py`.

This version talks directly to the in-process Conductor for both environment setup and grading, but still gives you the PromptToolkit + Rich UI.

#### Usage

Run the CLI:

```bash
python cli.py
```

#### Available Commands

- `start <problem_id>` - Run your selected problem
- `exit` - Exit the CLI


#### Features

- Use the `submit()` function in the console to test an agent submission
- Execute shell commands directly in the interactive console (e.g., kubectl commands)

<Callout type="warning">
Starting a new problem will restart any running app. Make sure you finish working before you start.
</Callout>

#### Example Usage

The CLI provides an interactive Python console where you can use CLI commands, test submissions, and execute shell commands:

```python
$ python cli.py
> start k8s_target_port-misconfig
Problem started: k8s_target_port-misconfig

# Test agent submissions
> submit("No")
> submit("Yes")

# Execute kubectl commands directly to inspect the cluster
> !kubectl logs my-pod -n default
> !kubectl describe pod my-pod
> !kubectl get services

# Exit the CLI
> exit
```

### MCP Inspector

[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is an interactive developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. It allows you to test MCP tools before integrating them into your agent.

#### Installation and Usage

The Inspector runs directly through `npx` without requiring installation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>
```

#### Features

The Inspector provides several features for interacting with your MCP server:

- **Tools tab**: Lists available tools, shows tool schemas and descriptions, enables tool testing with custom inputs, and displays tool execution results
- **Resources tab**: Lists all available resources, shows resource metadata, and allows resource content inspection
- **Prompts tab**: Displays available prompt templates and enables prompt testing with custom arguments
- **Notifications pane**: Presents all logs recorded from the server and shows notifications received

#### Connecting to SREGym MCP Server

To test SREGym's MCP tools:

1. Start SREGym with `python main.py` (the MCP server runs automatically)
2. Run the Inspector:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <connection-command>
   ```
3. Use the Tools tab to test individual MCP tools available in SREGym

For more details, see the [MCP Inspector documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

## Debugging
