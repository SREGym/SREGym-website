title: Running Your Own Agent
description: Guide to registering and running your custom agent in SREGym, including understanding evaluation phases and configuring task lists

## Agent Registration

SREGym uses [`agents.yaml`](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/blob/main/agents.yaml) to register agents for execution. This is how SREGym knows which agent to run when you start the benchmark. The Stratus agent is already registered:

```yaml
agents:
- name: stratus
  kickoff_command: python -m clients.stratus.stratus_agent.driver.driver --server http://localhost:8000
  kickoff_workdir: .
  kickoff_env: null
```

**To register your own agent:**
- `name`: A unique identifier for your agent
- `kickoff_command`: The command SREGym will execute to start your agent
- `kickoff_workdir`: The working directory from which to run the command
- `kickoff_env`: Optional environment variables (use `null` if none needed)

Add a new entry to `agents.yaml` following this format to register your custom agent.

## Understanding Evaluation Phases

There are at most 2 phases in each problem of SREGym:

1. **Fault Diagnosis**: The agent should localize where the incident originates and explain the root cause.

   **Expected submission**: The root cause of the incident in natural language.

2. **Incident Mitigation**: The agent should try to mitigate the incident and bring the cluster back online.

   **Expected submission**: No arguments for mitigation problems. *NOTE*: Not all problems are evaluated for mitigation.

## Configuring Task Lists

By default, SREGym runs the common evaluation with all available problems and tasks. If you want to run a **custom evaluation** with a specific subset of problems or tasks, you can configure this using [`tasklist.yaml`](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym/blob/main/SREGym/conductor/tasklist.yml).

The task list follows this format for each problem:

```yaml
k8s_target_port-misconfig:
  - diagnosis
  - mitigation
```


<Callout type="info">
If no entry exists for a problem in `tasklist.yaml`, all tasks will run by default. Additionally, `diagnosis` and `mitigation` may be skipped if the problem does not have a corresponding oracle attached.
</Callout>

## Monitoring Your Agent

SREGym provides a dashboard to monitor the status of your evaluation. The dashboard runs automatically when you start the benchmark with `python main.py` and can be accessed at `http://localhost:11451` in your web browser.
