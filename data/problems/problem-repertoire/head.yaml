      The problem runs on hotel-reservation.
      Simulate a correlated fault where multiple services in the hotel reservation application are deployed with incorrect Docker images.
      The deployment `frontend`, `geo`, `profile`, `rate`, `recommendation`, `reservation`, `user`, and `search` are configured to use a faulty image 'jackcuii/hotel-reservation:latest'.
      Inject the fault by updating the deployment images for all affected services simultaneously.

      The problem runs on hotel-reservation.
      Simulate a fault where the mongodb-rate service is missing in the hotel reservation application.
      The service `mongodb-rate` has been deleted, causing service discovery failures for dependent services.
      Inject the fault by deleting or failing to create the Kubernetes service for the mongodb-rate service.

      The problem runs on hotel-reservation.
      Simulate a fault where namespace-level memory limits are set too restrictively.
      The namespace has a ResourceQuota with a memory limit (1Gi) that is too restrictive, preventing the deployment `search` from scheduling new pods or causing existing pods to be evicted.
      Inject the fault by setting restrictive memory limits at the namespace ResourceQuota level.

      The problem runs on social-network.
      Simulate a fault where pod anti-affinity rules create a scheduling deadlock.
      The deployment `user-service` has strict pod anti-affinity rules (requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution) that prevent multiple replicas from being scheduled on the same node, but with insufficient nodes, causing a scheduling deadlock where pods remain in Pending state.
      Inject the fault by configuring pod anti-affinity rules that create unresolvable scheduling constraints.
