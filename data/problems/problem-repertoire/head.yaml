      The problem runs on hotel-reservation.
      Simulate a correlated fault where multiple services in the hotel reservation application are deployed with incorrect Docker images.
      The fault manifests as all frontend, geo, profile, rate, recommendation, reservation, user, and search services using a faulty image (jackcuii/hotel-reservation:latest) instead of the correct ones.
      Inject the fault by updating the deployment images for all affected services simultaneously.
